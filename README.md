# ALE OmniSwitch scripts
These are some scripts I've written over the years to help manage the Alcatel Lucent switches I manage on my own network.  They should be AOS 8.x compatible and I've tried to write them in a way that they're compatible both from CLI as well as deployed from an OV2500, though I cannot guarantee that I've verified they all work with an OV2500.
